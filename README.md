## About Media entity

Media entity provides a 'base' entity for a media element. This is a very basic
entity which can reference to all kinds of media-objects (local files, YouTube
videos, tweets, CDN-files, ...). This entity only provides a relation between
Drupal (because it is an entity) and the resource. You can reference to this
entity within any other Drupal entity.

## About Media entity icon

This module provides SVG sprites/icons integration for Media entity (i.e. media type
provider plugin).

Features:
 - SVG sprite and SVG icon media types
 - Supports both local and CDN sprite sources
 - Sprite administration page to see the available icons, the ones created and the obsolete ones (in case of a source change)
 - Option to automatically create icons on a new sprite creation
 - Option to automatically create missing icons on a sprite update
 - Icon thumbnail can be generated as a PNG via SVG2PNG
 - Theme to render SVG icons based on an inline call with a use tag

## Configuration

Thumbnail width and SVG2PNG can be configured on the settings page: /admin/config/media/media_entity_icon  
This requires the "administer site configuration" permission.

Automated creation of icons at SVG creation/update can be set on the SVG sprite bundle: /admin/structure/media/manage/svg_sprite  
This requires the "administer media bundles" permission.

Related icons can be managed as a dedicated tab on the SVG media entity: /media/{media}/related_icons  
Accessing to the page requires the "access related icons" permission.  
Creating icons automatically or via the related icon page requires either "create media" or "autocreate icon" permission.

## Working with SVG sprites

An icon must be coupled with a sprite to work, the SVG sprite entity represents the source file and the SVG icon a pointer to a symbol within it.

The SVG parser expect a wrapping ```<svg>```, in which each icon is defined by a ```<symbol>``` with an "id" attribute and some size attributes (either "viewbox" or "width" and "height).

For example, a very simple SVG sprite with a square, a disc and a triangle:
```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <symbol id="square" viewBox="0 0 30 30">
    <rect x="0" y="0" width="30" height="30"/>
  </symbol>
  <symbol id="disc" viewBox="0 0 30 30">
    <circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15"/>
  </symbol>
  <symbol id="triangle" viewBox="0 0 30 30">
    <polygon points="0 30,30 30,15 0"/>
  </symbol>
</svg>
```

## Recommanded

For thumbnail generation, we advise you to install svg2png (requires nodejs):
```
npm install -g svg2png
```
